Network & Web Security Testing – Internship Project
Network-and-Web-Security-Testing-

📌 Overview

This project documents a structured security assessment performed on a web application during my cybersecurity internship. The assessment focused on network reconnaissance, directory enumeration, and traffic analysis.

⚠️ All testing was conducted in an authorized environment with proper permission.

🎯 Scope of Assessment

● Identify exposed network ports

● Discover hidden directories and endpoints

● Analyze unencrypted network traffic

● Document findings and remediation steps

🛠 Tools Used

● Nmap – Port Scanning

● Wireshark – Network Traffic Analysis

● Kali Linux

🔎 Phase 1 – Port Enumeration

Method: -> nmap -Pn -p- testphp.vulnweb.com

Findings: ● Open HTTP/HTTPS ports

● Additional exposed service (if any)

● Service version detection

📡 Phase 2 – Traffic Interception & Analysis

Analysis Focus: ● HTTP requests & responses

● Unencrypted credentials

● Cookie/session data

● Packet-level inspection

🛑 Security Risks Identified ● Open unnecessary ports

● Exposed sensitive directories

● Transmission of data over HTTP (no encryption)

🛡 Remediation Recommendations ● Close unused ports

● Disable directory indexing

● Enforce HTTPS with TLS

● Implement WAF

● Restrict admin panel access

📊 Risk Summary

Issue	Severity	Impact
Open Port Exposure	Medium	Attack surface increase
Hidden Admin Panel	High	Unauthorized access risk
Unencrypted Traffic	Critical	Credential interception

⚖️ Ethical Disclaimer

This assessment was conducted under authorized internship supervision. The purpose of this project is educational documentation and defensive security awareness.

🚀 Step 3: VERY IMPORTANT – Protect Yourself

Never: ❌ Put real domain name

❌ Upload sensitive captured packets

❌ Upload real credentials

❌ Mention company name (unless permitted)
